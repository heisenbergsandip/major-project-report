\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Development of a Functional Fixed-Wing UAV:} A fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle will be designed and developed, equipped with essential components including a camera module and a receiver, to enable autonomous aerial image capturing during flight.
    
    \item \textbf{Generation of High-Resolution Aerial Images:} The captured low-resolution images will be processed using deep learning-based image upscaling techniques to generate high-resolution outputs suitable for detailed analysis.
    
    \item \textbf{Implementation of Land Use Classification:} The upscaled images will be used to perform land use classification by applying a trained deep learning-based classification model to accurately distinguish various land cover types.
\end{itemize}
