\subsection{System Description}

The system consists of a fixed-wing UAV platform equipped with essential components for flight and data collection. The UAV includes:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{ESC (Electronic Speed Controller):} Regulates the speed of the motor driving the propeller.
    \item \textbf{Propeller:} Provides thrust for UAV flight.
    \item \textbf{4 Servos:} Control the movement of aerodynamic surfaces like ailerons, elevator, and rudder for flight maneuverability.
    \item \textbf{Battery:} Powers the entire onboard system.
    \item \textbf{UAV Receiver:} Receives control signals from the ground-based transmitter.
    \item \textbf{Raspberry Pi + Camera Module:} Captures aerial images during flight.
\end{itemize}

The ground transmitter sends flight control commands to the UAV receiver. The Raspberry Pi processes input from the onboard camera and stores captured images.

These images are then passed to the image upscaling module using deep learning methods, enhancing the resolution and clarity. The upscaled images are further processed through a classification model to identify land use categories.

Finally, the results from the classification are analyzed for insights, contributing to high-resolution land use mapping from UAV-acquired data.
